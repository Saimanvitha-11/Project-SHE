# Project SHE — Self Healing Environment

**A personal OS for emotional wellness, productivity, and growth.**

## Overview

Project SHE is a deeply personal and evolving wellness platform built to support healing, structure, and self-awareness.

What began as a simple daily tracker has grown into a full self-care ecosystem integrating:

- Mental health reflection  
- Daily routine structure  
- Emotional intelligence tools  
- Growth tracking  
- Music therapy  
- A custom vision board  
- An in-app personal AI mentor  

Every component is hand-designed with a soft, feminine UI and calming interactions — built as a safe space for rebuilding confidence, discipline, and emotional clarity.

This project is actively evolving and will continue to grow with new features and backend support.
